Welcome to pdxsolarsystem!

This is a reboot of the pdxsolarsytem project by OMSI. 

A few years ago we stumbled upon an old brass plate near OMSI with the
pdxsolarsystem.com address stamped on it. After finding that the URL had lapsed
and the page left vacant, we decided to buy it and dig the remains of the site
from the wayback machine. 

Coming soon:
New brass(or some cheap metal) plates!
Possible permission to rebuild!(probably not)
Pictures!
